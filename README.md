# NixOS config files

This is my first attempt at maintaining a modular NixOS configuration that can be easily used on any machine after a simple pull with Git.

This current setup installs a variety of packages and the Hyprland window manager with default settings. Future versions of this will include all configuration files and will be referenced in home manager for ease of use.
